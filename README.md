# Quote Generator

Welcome to the Quote Generator!
This project is a simple and elegant application that dynamically displays random quotes along with their authors.
Built with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it leverages modern web technologies to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **HTML**: Provides the foundational structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Adds styling and ensures the application looks visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Adds functionality to fetch and display quotes, as well as enabling user interactions.

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Quotes**: The application uses the `fetch` method to call an API that provides a list of quotes in JSON format.
2. **Display Quotes**: Through DOM manipulation, the fetched data is processed to display a quote along with the author's name.
3. **User Interactions**:
   - **Generate New Quote**: A button that, when clicked, fetches and displays a new random quote.
   - **Tweet Quote**: A button that allows users to share the current quote on Twitter.

├── styles.css         # The CSS file for styling
└── script.js          # The JavaScript file for functionality
```

## DOM Manipulation

JavaScript is used extensively to manipulate the DOM, ensuring that the application updates the displayed quote and author correctly with each interaction.
