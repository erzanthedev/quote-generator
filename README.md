# Quote Generator 📜

Welcome to the **Quote Generator**!
This project is a simple and elegant application that dynamically displays random quotes along with their authors.
Built with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it leverages modern web technologies to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Features ✨

- **HTML**: Provides the foundational structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Adds styling and ensures the application looks visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Adds functionality to fetch and display quotes, as well as enabling user interactions.

## How It Works ⚙️

- **Fetch Quotes**: The application uses the `fetch` method to call an API that provides a list of quotes in JSON format.
- **Display Quotes**: Through DOM manipulation, the fetched data is processed to display a quote along with the author's name.

### User Interactions 🖱️

- **Generate New Quote**: A button that, when clicked, fetches and displays a new random quote.
- **Tweet Quote**: A button that allows users to share the current quote on Twitter.
